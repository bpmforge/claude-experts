## What's New (★ marked above)

### 1. USE_CASES.md in Phase 2

SDLC lead writes this INLINE (not a handoff) because it derives directly from requirements:
- One use case per user story from USER_STORIES.md
- Each has: persona, preconditions, trigger, main flow, alt flows, success criteria
- This is the source of truth for what gets tested

### 2. TEST_PLAN.md via test-engineer in Phase 2

After USE_CASES.md is written, test-engineer reviews it and produces TEST_PLAN.md:
- Assigns P0/P1/P2 priority to each use case
- Maps each to a test file name
- Defines cross-cutting checks (no console errors, no 5xx, loading states)
- This is the test backlog — tracked through Phase 4

### 3. E2E test writing in Phase 4 (AFTER implementation)

Currently Phase 4 only produces TEST_STRATEGY.md (framework choices) and tells the developer to "write tests alongside code." That's aspirational — developers skip it under time pressure.

**New:** After implementation is done, SDLC lead hands off to test-engineer with a specific task:
- Read USE_CASES.md + TEST_PLAN.md
- Write one E2E spec per P0 use case
- Write shared fixtures helper
- Run the full suite
- Report pass/fail count

This catches integration issues (like the ones we found in ThreatForge) BEFORE code review starts.

### 4. Discovery audit after implementation

SDLC lead runs an inline discovery check:
- Navigate every page/endpoint the app exposes
- Collect: console errors, 4xx/5xx responses, visible error text, slow loads
- Produce: docs/audits/discovery-YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Triage: fix blockers before sending to code-reviewer

### 5. P0 gate before code review

Code-reviewer and security-auditor should not waste time reviewing code that doesn't pass its own tests. New gate: all P0 tests must be green before review starts.

## Context Packet Protocol (for all HANDOFFs)

Before every HANDOFF, SDLC lead prepares a context packet — NOT in the handoff prompt itself (that's for task instructions), but as a separate file the agent reads:

```
write(filePath="docs/work/context-for-{agent}.md", content="
# Context Packet for {agent}

## Project (3 sentences from DISCOVERY.md)
## Your task (specific: what to do, what to produce)
## Files to read (in priority order, with what's relevant in each)
## Files to produce (with expected content description)
## Patterns to follow (from CODING_MEMORY.md or project conventions)
## What NOT to do (scope boundaries)
")
```

Then in the HANDOFF prompt:
```
CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/work/context-for-{agent}.md — full context for this task
- [specific file 1]
- [specific file 2]
```

### Why: agents that re-explore the codebase waste 30-50% of their context on orientation. A focused context packet front-loads them.

## Completion Manifest Protocol (for all returning agents)

Every specialist must end with:

```
# Completion: {agent} — {task summary}
Files produced: [list with line counts]
Files modified: [list with what changed]
Tests: [new count, existing pass/fail, test command]
Decisions: [key choices made, with reasoning]
Known issues: [deferred items, with why]
Ready for: {next agent or "SDLC lead resume"}
```

SDLC lead reads this, verifies files exist + have content, runs the test command, then continues.

### Why: "check file exists with >50 lines" is too weak. Completion manifests give structured verification.

## Post-HANDOFF Automated Gates (v0.15.0)

After EVERY specialist HANDOFF returns and before accepting the work, the orchestrator runs three automated gates via `./scripts/validators/run-handoff-gates.sh`:

```
run-handoff-gates.sh \
  --scope <assigned-dir> [--scope <dir2> ...] \
  --manifest <manifest-path> \
  [--coverage validate-<name>.sh]
```

Three gates, any failure aborts the rest:

| Gate | Script | What it checks |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1. Scope | `validate-scope.sh` | `git status --porcelain` confined to assigned dir(s) + `docs/work/**` + `docs/reviews/**` |
| 2. Manifest | `validate-completion-manifest.sh` | Required sections + completion phrase |
| 3. Coverage | domain validator | Coverage fact (architecture / api / erd / owasp / inventory) |

**HANDOFF type → `--coverage` mapping:**

| HANDOFF type | `--coverage` arg |
|--------------|------------------|
| api-designer | `validate-api-coverage.sh` |
| db-architect | `validate-erd-coverage.sh` |
| architecture synthesis | `validate-architecture.sh` |
| security-auditor --deep | `validate-owasp.sh` |
| onboard --deep | `validate-inventory.sh` |
| code/refactor | omit |

Any gate failure returns the HANDOFF with REVISE status + the specific gap. No orchestrator judgment required. Replaces the manual "read the manifest and decide" step.

---

## Ralph Wiggum Loop (Deep Verification)

Used by `/sdlc onboard --deep` and `/security --deep`. Canonical protocol: `agents/shared/RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP.md`.

```
1. INVENTORY   → enumerate the universe (one row per unit: route, table, service, flow, entry)
2. DISCOVER    → produce one artifact per inventory row (parallel waves by category)
3. VERIFY      → validator script confirms 100% coverage
4. GAP         → re-discover ONLY the uncovered rows (one row = one HANDOFF)
5. REPEAT      → until coverage = 100% OR 3 iterations (then escalate)
```

Replaces confidence-score self-evaluation with coverage-percentage facts. Either every row has an artifact or it does not — no feeling, no interpretation.

**For `/sdlc onboard --deep`:** inventory file is `docs/onboard/INVENTORY.md`. Validator is `validate-phase-gate.sh onboard-deep`.

**For `/security --deep`:** inventory is the OWASP tracker + semgrep rule-file coverage + 9 attack-chain patterns. Validator is `validate-phase-gate.sh security-deep`.

Three sub-skills trigger the individual onboard-deep steps: `/onboard-inventory` (D1), `/onboard-verify` (D3), `/onboard-gap-fill` (D4).

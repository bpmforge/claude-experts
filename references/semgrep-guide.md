# SAST Scanning Guide (Opengrep-first)

**Last updated:** 2026-07-16
**Preferred engine:** Opengrep (LGPL-2.1 fork of Semgrep) — https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep
**Fallback engine:** Semgrep CE (LGPL-2.1) — dev machines only
**Rules:** in-house `bpm-rulepacks` (proprietary) — NOT the Semgrep registry

> ## ⚠ Licensing — read before you scan for anyone but yourself
> The Semgrep **engine** is fine to run commercially. The Semgrep **registry rules**
> (`--config auto`, `--config p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/security-audit`, `p/secrets`,
> `p/default`) are under the Semgrep Rules License v1.0 (Dec 2024): usable only for
> "your own internal business purposes" — **making them available to others as a
> service is prohibited.** Any scan run on behalf of a client (a CodeReckon audit, a
> RepoPulse SaaS scan) driven through these experts must therefore use **Opengrep +
> our own `bpm-rulepacks`**, never the registry packs. Third-party registry packs
> inherit their own licenses (Trail of Bits rules are AGPL — excluded). When in
> doubt, run only `bpm-rulepacks` rules on the LGPL engine.

## What it is

Opengrep is an AST-based static analysis tool — a maintained LGPL fork of Semgrep
governed by a 10+ vendor consortium, created so scanning vendors could keep using it.
It is CLI- and rule-format-compatible with Semgrep, restores fingerprints/LOC/SARIF
metadata that Semgrep CE gated, and adds **free intra-file cross-function taint**
(`--taint-intrafile`) that Semgrep CE never had.

Unlike grep/regex, it understands code structure — `hashlib.md5(...)` matches ANY call
regardless of whitespace or argument formatting, with far fewer false positives.

The tools in this repo (`semgrep-scan`, `semgrep-rule`) auto-resolve the engine:
Opengrep if installed, else Semgrep. Override with `SAST_ENGINE=opengrep|semgrep`.
Point them at the in-house packs with `RULEPACKS_DIR=/path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs`.

## Installation

```bash
# Opengrep (preferred) — see https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep for current installer
brew install opengrep   # or the official install script

# Semgrep (fallback, dev only)
brew install semgrep     # or: pip install semgrep
```

## Core CLI Commands

`opengrep` is a drop-in for `semgrep` in all commands below (swap the binary name).

### Full Security Scan (recommended starting point)
```bash
# In-house rulepacks — the licensing-safe default for client work
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs

# Add intra-file cross-function taint
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs --taint-intrafile

# Scan a specific directory
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs src/

# JSON output for report generation
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs --json -o sast-results.json

# SARIF output (for GitHub Security tab, report generator, RepoPulse findings store)
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs --sarif -o sast-results.sarif

# Only scan changed files (CI optimization)
opengrep scan --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs --diff-depth 1
```

### Comprehensive Security Audit Command
```bash
# Run the full in-house pack set. NEVER substitute registry packs (p/…) for client work.
opengrep scan \
  --config /path/to/bpm-rulepacks/packs \
  --taint-intrafile \
  --json \
  -o docs/security/sast-results.json \
  2>&1 | tee docs/security/sast-scan.log
```

## Local dev-only exception

For scanning **your own** projects on your own machine, the Semgrep registry packs
(`--config auto`, `p/…`) remain licensed for internal use and can still be handy for
breadth. They must never enter a client audit or the SaaS scan path — those run
`bpm-rulepacks` only. See `bpm-rulepacks/docs/AUTHORING.md` to add coverage.

## (Legacy) Semgrep registry packs — internal use only

Historically these experts pointed at `https://semgrep.dev/explore` via `--config p/<pack>`.
Retained here only for local dev breadth under the internal-use license.

### Security-Focused Rule Packs

| Pack | Command | What It Finds |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **OWASP Top 10** | `p/owasp-top-ten` | All 10 OWASP categories |
| **Security Audit** | `p/security-audit` | Broad security patterns |
| **Secrets** | `p/secrets` | Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens |
| **Default** | `p/default` | Semgrep's recommended rules |
| **CI** | `p/ci` | Optimized for CI pipelines (fast, high-signal) |

### Language-Specific Security Packs

| Language | Pack | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | `p/javascript`, `p/typescript` | XSS, prototype pollution, eval |
| Python | `p/python` | SQL injection, command injection, pickle |
| Go | `p/golang` | Race conditions, unsafe pointers, crypto |
| Java | `p/java` | Deserialization, JNDI, SQL injection |
| Kotlin | `p/kotlin` | Kotlin-specific patterns + shares Java rules |
| C# / .NET | `p/csharp` | SQL injection, LDAP injection, XSS, insecure deserialization |
| C | `p/c` | Buffer overflow, format string, use-after-free (covers C and C++ files) |
| C++ | `p/c` (**`p/cpp` is dead — 404**) | Same pack as C — Semgrep's `p/c` parses both `.c` and `.cpp` |
| Rust | `p/rust` | Unsafe blocks, memory issues |
| Swift | `p/swift` | iOS security, insecure storage, transport security |
| Ruby | `p/ruby` | Mass assignment, CSRF, SQL injection |
| PHP | `p/php` | SQL injection, file inclusion, XSS |
| Scala | `p/scala` | Scala-specific patterns |

### OWASP Pack → Category Mapping

| OWASP Category | What Semgrep Catches |
|----------------|---------------------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | Missing auth checks, IDOR patterns, CORS misconfig |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | Weak hashing (MD5/SHA1), hardcoded keys, insecure TLS |
| A03: Injection | SQL injection, command injection, XSS, LDAP injection, template injection |
| A04: Insecure Design | Missing rate limiting patterns, business logic issues |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | Debug mode enabled, default credentials, verbose errors |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | Known CVE patterns in dependency usage |
| A07: Auth Failures | Weak JWT validation, session issues, credential exposure |
| A08: Data Integrity | Insecure deserialization, unsigned updates |
| A09: Logging Failures | Sensitive data in logs, missing audit trails |
| A10: SSRF | Unvalidated URL inputs to HTTP clients |

## JSON Output Format

When using `--json`, each finding has this structure:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "check_id": "javascript.express.security.audit.xss.mustache-escape",
      "path": "src/api/routes.ts",
      "start": { "line": 42, "col": 5 },
      "end": { "line": 42, "col": 38 },
      "extra": {
        "message": "User input flows into response without escaping, enabling XSS",
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "metadata": {
          "owasp": ["A03:2021 - Injection"],
          "cwe": ["CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting"],
          "confidence": "HIGH",
          "references": ["https://owasp.org/..."]
        },
        "lines": "  res.send(`Hello ${req.query.name}`);"
      }
    }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "stats": {
    "findings": 12,
    "errors": 0,
    "total_time": 3.2
  }
}
```

### Key Fields for Report Generation

| Field | Use In Report |
|-------|--------------|
| `check_id` | Rule identifier — categorize findings |
| `path` + `start.line` | File:line reference |
| `extra.severity` | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL |
| `extra.message` | Finding description |
| `extra.metadata.owasp` | OWASP category mapping |
| `extra.metadata.cwe` | CWE number |
| `extra.lines` | Code snippet (evidence) |

## Parsing Results for Report

```bash
# Count findings by severity
cat semgrep-results.json | jq '.results | group_by(.extra.severity) | map({severity: .[0].extra.severity, count: length})'

# List all CRITICAL/HIGH findings
cat semgrep-results.json | jq '[.results[] | select(.extra.severity == "HIGH" or .extra.severity == "CRITICAL") | {rule: .check_id, file: .path, line: .start.line, severity: .extra.severity, message: .extra.message}]'

# Group by OWASP category
cat semgrep-results.json | jq '[.results[] | {owasp: .extra.metadata.owasp[0], file: .path, line: .start.line, severity: .extra.severity}] | group_by(.owasp)'
```

## Writing Custom Rules

Create project-specific rules in `.semgrep/` or `semgrep-rules/`:

```yaml
# semgrep-rules/custom-auth-check.yaml
rules:
  - id: missing-auth-middleware
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          app.$METHOD($PATH, (req, res) => { ... })
      - pattern-not: |
          app.$METHOD($PATH, authMiddleware, (req, res) => { ... })
      - pattern-not: |
          app.$METHOD($PATH, authenticate, (req, res) => { ... })
    message: >
      Route handler missing authentication middleware.
      All endpoints should use authMiddleware or authenticate.
    severity: HIGH
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    metadata:
      owasp: ["A01:2021 - Broken Access Control"]
      cwe: ["CWE-862: Missing Authorization"]

  - id: no-sql-string-concat
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          $DB.query(`...${$VAR}...`)
      - pattern-not-inside: |
          $DB.query($PARAM, [...])
    message: >
      SQL query uses string interpolation instead of parameterized queries.
      Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    severity: CRITICAL
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
    metadata:
      owasp: ["A03:2021 - Injection"]
      cwe: ["CWE-89: SQL Injection"]
```

Run custom rules:
```bash
semgrep scan --config ./semgrep-rules/ --config p/owasp-top-ten
```

## Taint Tracking (Advanced)

Semgrep can track data flow from user input (sources) to dangerous operations (sinks):

```yaml
rules:
  - id: tainted-sql-query
    mode: taint
    pattern-sources:
      - pattern: req.query.$PARAM
      - pattern: req.body.$PARAM
      - pattern: req.params.$PARAM
    pattern-sinks:
      - pattern: $DB.query($SINK, ...)
    message: User input flows into SQL query without sanitization
    severity: CRITICAL
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
```

## False Positive Handling

```javascript
// nosemgrep: rule-id-here
const legit = eval(trustedCode); // This is intentional

// Or suppress all rules for a line:
// nosemgrep
const x = dangerousButIntentional();
```

**Best practice:** Don't suppress — fix. Only use `nosemgrep` with a comment explaining WHY.

## Performance

- Semgrep scans at ~10,000-20,000 lines/second
- A 100K LOC codebase typically scans in 10-30 seconds
- `--config auto` is slower than specific packs (downloads all rules)
- For CI: use `--config p/ci` for fast, high-signal scans
- For full audits: use multiple specific packs

## Two-Tier Scan Strategy

Don't run one big scan for every situation. Use two tiers:

### Tier 1 — Fast (CI / continuous feedback)
**Goal:** < 60 seconds. High signal, low noise. Runs on every commit.

```bash
semgrep scan \
  --config p/ci \
  --config p/secrets \
  --config p/<language> \
  --metrics=off
```

- `p/ci` is optimized for CI: Semgrep's curated set of high-precision rules
- Only secrets + one language pack — everything else is deferred to the deep audit
- Target use: pre-commit hook, PR check, save-on-write

### Tier 2 — Deep (manual audit, before-deploy gate)
**Goal:** 5-15 minutes. Full coverage. Runs on `/security` invocation.

```bash
semgrep scan \
  --config p/owasp-top-ten \
  --config p/security-audit \
  --config p/secrets \
  --config p/default \
  --config p/<language> \
  --config p/<framework> \
  --config p/dockerfile \
  --config p/kubernetes \
  --config p/github-actions \
  --config ~/.semgrep/rules/trailofbits/<language> \
  --config ~/.semgrep/rules/elttam/rules/<language> \
  --config ~/.semgrep/rules/gitlab/<language> \
  --config .semgrep/project-rules \
  --json --sarif --metrics=off \
  -o docs/security/semgrep-results.json
```

The `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh` script handles all of this automatically — detects language, framework, IaC presence, and composes the right config list.

> **Registry pack availability warning:** Some packs listed in the Framework Auto-Detection table (e.g., `p/express`, `p/nextjs`) have been deprecated in the free registry tier or moved to Semgrep Pro. Attempting to use a 404'd pack causes semgrep to write an empty `results: []` array — this looks identical to "no findings" but the pack was never actually run. `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh` probes each pack before use and skips 404s with a warning in the scan log. Never manually construct `--config` flag lists for registry packs — always let the script handle it.

---

## Framework Auto-Detection

Beyond language packs, framework-specific packs catch framework anti-patterns the language packs miss:

| Framework | Detect via | Pack |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Express | `"express"` in `package.json` | `p/express` ⚠️ DEAD — probed + skipped by script |
| Next.js | `"next"` in `package.json` | `p/nextjs` ⚠️ DEAD — probed + skipped by script |
| React | `"react"` in `package.json` | `p/react` |
| Django | `django` in `requirements.txt` | `p/django` |
| Flask | `flask` in `requirements.txt` | `p/flask` |
| Ruby on Rails | `rails` in `Gemfile` | `p/rails` |
| Spring Boot | `spring-boot` in `pom.xml` | `p/spring` ⚠️ DEAD — probed + skipped by script |
| Gin | `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` in `go.mod` | `p/gin` |
| Node.js | `"express"` or `"fastify"` in `package.json` | `p/nodejsscan` ✓ confirmed working |

**Note on dead packs:** `p/express`, `p/nextjs`, and `p/spring` return HTTP 404 as of Semgrep 1.159.0.
`semgrep-full-audit.sh` probes each pack and logs + skips dead ones. Do not use them manually.
`p/nodejsscan` (Node.js command injection, SQL injection, hardcoded secrets) is confirmed working and fills the gap.

**Example findings only framework/Node packs catch:**
- `p/nodejsscan` flags command injection via `child_process.exec(userInput)` → RCE
- `p/nodejsscan` flags hardcoded API keys in Node.js source → credential exposure
- `p/django` flags `@csrf_exempt` on state-mutating views → CSRF
- `p/react` flags `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unescaped content → XSS

---

## Infrastructure-as-Code Rules

If the project has infra code, include these:

| IaC Type | Detect via | Pack |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Docker | `Dockerfile*` exists | `p/dockerfile` |
| Terraform | `*.tf` files | `p/terraform` |
| Kubernetes | `k8s/` or `kubernetes/` or `helm/` | `p/kubernetes` |
| GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/*.yml` | `p/github-actions` |
| Ansible | `playbooks/*.yml` | `p/ansible` |

**Examples of findings:**
- `p/dockerfile` — running as root, missing `HEALTHCHECK`, `curl | bash` anti-pattern, `apt-get` without version pinning
- `p/github-actions` — `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}` in shell commands (script injection), unpinned action versions (`@main` instead of `@v4.1.2`), excessive `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
- `p/kubernetes` — containers running as root, privileged containers, missing resource limits, hostPath mounts

---

## Community Rule Sources

The official Registry is good, but the highest-signal rules come from independent security firms. See `semgrep-community-rules.md` for the full list, clone commands, and pinning strategy. Summary:

| Source | Focus | License | Status |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Trail of Bits** | Go, Python, JS/TS, Dockerfile, Solidity | AGPLv3 | HIGHEST PRIORITY |
| **elttam** | JavaScript/TypeScript taint tracking | MIT | HIGH |
| **GitLab SAST** | Multi-language (rules powering GitLab SAST) | MIT | HIGH |
| **0xdea** | C/C++ memory safety | MIT | HIGH for C/C++ projects |

Install with `scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh` (clones to `~/.semgrep/rules/`). Pin commits in `.semgrep/community-rules.lock`. Refresh quarterly.

---

## Offline / Air-Gapped Scanning

Semgrep registry packs (`p/javascript`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, etc.) normally require an internet connection — `semgrep scan --config p/foo` hits `semgrep.dev` to fetch the rules at scan time. For offline environments (air-gapped networks, CI without internet, planes):

### Setup (run once while online)

```bash
# 1. Download all registry pack YAML files to local cache
scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh

# 2. Clone community rule repos
scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh

# Both commands together:
scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh && scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh
```

Cache location: `~/.semgrep/registry-cache/` (override with `SEMGREP_REGISTRY_CACHE`).

### Running offline

```bash
# Full audit using only cached packs — no network required
scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --offline

# Combine with other flags
scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --offline --fast
```

### How it works

The `add_registry_pack()` function in `semgrep-full-audit.sh` uses this resolution order:

1. **Local cache** (`~/.semgrep/registry-cache/<pack>.yml`) — preferred, no network hit
2. **Live registry** (`p/<pack>`) — probed, skipped on HTTP 404
3. **`--offline` mode** — only option 1 is allowed; missing packs are skipped with a warning

Even without `--offline`, if cache files exist they are used first (faster, no network latency).

### Cache management

```bash
# Check what's cached and how old it is
scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh --status

# Re-download all packs (overwrite existing)
scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh --refresh

# Remove dead/empty pack files
scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh --prune

# Also accessible via update-semgrep-rules.sh
scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh --cache-packs
```

### Known dead packs (as of 2026-04-13)

These registry packs return HTTP 404 or empty YAML and are skipped automatically:

| Pack | Status | Replacement |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `p/cpp` | 404 — removed | `p/c` (thin), community 0xdea + GitLab, **cpp-bridge rules** |
| `p/express` | 404 — removed | Rules merged into `p/javascript` + `p/nodejsscan` |
| `p/nextjs` | Empty (`rules: []`) | `p/react` + `p/javascript` |
| `p/rails` | 404 — removed | `p/ruby` + `p/brakeman` |
| `p/gin` | 404 — removed | `p/golang` + `p/gosec` |
| `p/spring` | 404 — removed | `p/java` |
| `p/ci` | Meta-pack (not static) | `p/default` + `p/secrets` + language packs |

### C/C++ coverage note

The `p/c` registry pack has only 2 rules and `p/cpp` is dead. To compensate, this toolchain provides:

1. **cpp-bridge rules** (`.semgrep/cpp-bridge-rules/cpp-security.yml`) — 15 custom rules covering buffer overflow, format string, memory safety, command injection, crypto weakness, and deprecated function usage. Targets `languages: [c, cpp]` so they fire on both `.c` and `.cpp` files.
2. **0xdea community rules** (~50 rules for C/C++ memory safety)
3. **GitLab SAST community rules** (~20+ rules for C)

All three load automatically when C/C++ files are detected in the project.

### Custom gap-filler rulesets

Several registry packs have thin coverage. Custom rulesets in `.semgrep/custom-rules/` fill the OWASP Top 10 gaps. They load automatically when `semgrep-full-audit.sh` detects the corresponding language.

| File | Lang | Rules | Gaps Filled |
|------|------|------:|-------------|
| `kotlin-security.yml` | Kotlin | 16 | `p/kotlin` has 10 rules, all crypto. Adds: SQL injection (JDBC + Android rawQuery), command injection, hardcoded secrets, deserialization, SSRF, WebView misconfig, path traversal, cleartext traffic, sensitive logging |
| `swift-security.yml` | Swift | 17 | `p/swift` has 2 rules. Adds: weak hashes (MD5/SHA1), hardcoded keys, ECB mode, SQLite injection, WebView XSS, insecure HTTP, SSL bypass, keychain accessibility, file protection, path traversal, SSRF |
| `rust-security.yml` | Rust | 15 | `p/rust` has 11 rules (SSL/unsafe focused). Adds: SQL injection (format! macro), command injection, hardcoded secrets, unwrap/expect/panic abuse, path traversal, SSRF, sensitive logging |
| `php-security.yml` | PHP | 15 | `p/php` has 24 rules. Adds: unserialize RCE, include/require LFI, file upload, type juggling, hash timing, session fixation, preg /e injection, eval, XXE, SSRF |
| `csharp-security.yml` | C# | 20 | `p/csharp` has 27 rules. Adds: command injection (Process.Start), XSS (Html.Raw), LDAP injection, path traversal, SSRF (HttpClient + WebRequest), hardcoded secrets, CORS wildcard, weak hashing, sensitive logging, insecure cookies |
| `cpp-security.yml`* | C/C++ | 15 | See "C/C++ coverage note" above |

\* Located in `.semgrep/cpp-bridge-rules/` (separate directory, loaded independently).

**Total custom rules: 98** across 6 languages. Combined with registry packs and community repos, every supported language now has broad OWASP Top 10 coverage.

**Testing results** (against purpose-built vulnerability probe files):

| Ruleset | Hit Rate | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| C# | 100% (20/20) | All rules fire on probe |
| Rust | 87% (13/15) | 2 rules need real ORM context (diesel/sqlx) |
| PHP | 67% (10/15) | 5 rules need PHP runtime taint context |
| Swift | 53% (9/17) | Remaining rules need Xcode/iOS SDK context |
| Kotlin | 44% (7/16) | Android-specific rules need SDK context |

Rules that don't fire on probes will fire on real projects with the appropriate framework imports and SDK context.

---

## Baseline Scanning (Repeat Audits)

For a repeat audit, you don't want to re-report every finding from last time. Use `--baseline-ref` to only surface NEW findings since a git reference:

```bash
# Only findings new since the last audit commit
semgrep scan --config ... --baseline-ref <last-audit-commit>

# Only findings new since the last release tag
semgrep scan --config ... --baseline-ref v2.1.0

# For PR review — only findings on changed lines
semgrep scan --config ... --baseline-ref origin/main
```

**How it works:** Semgrep runs the scan on the current code AND on the baseline ref, then diffs the findings. Only findings that appear in the current scan but not in the baseline are reported.

**Tracking:** After each audit, save the commit hash. The security-auditor agent stores this in `docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json`:

```json
{
  "commit": "abc123def4567890",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T14:23:00Z",
  "findings_total": 47,
  "findings_by_severity": {"HIGH": 3, "MEDIUM": 12, "LOW": 32}
}
```

Next audit uses this commit as the baseline.

---

## Finding Triage

Not every finding needs to be fixed. Some are false positives, some are accepted risks. Track them in `docs/security/TRIAGE.md`:

```markdown
# Security Finding Triage

## Fixed
| Finding | Rule ID | File:Line | Fixed In | By |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|-----|
| SQL injection in login | javascript.express.sqli | src/auth.ts:42 | 2026-04-05 | alice |

## False Positives
| Finding | Rule ID | File:Line | Reason | Suppressed With |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| eval() in template engine | javascript.lang.eval | src/template.ts:88 | Template engine uses eval internally, input is validated upstream at src/router.ts:15 | `// nosemgrep: javascript.lang.eval` |

## Accepted Risk
| Finding | Rule ID | File:Line | Justification | Owner | Expires |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------------|-------|---------|
| MD5 used in non-crypto context | python.lang.md5 | src/cache_key.py:23 | Used for cache key only, not security | bmatthews | 2026-10-01 |
```

**Agent integration:** Before reporting a finding, check TRIAGE.md. If the finding matches a `Fixed` row → don't report. If it matches `False Positive` → report at INFO level with the justification. If it matches `Accepted Risk` and the expiry hasn't passed → report at INFO with the owner/expiry. If accepted-risk expiry has passed → bump to original severity and flag for re-review.

## Complementary Tools

Semgrep is strong at AST-based pattern matching, but it's not the only tool in the audit. Use these alongside:

### Secrets (Semgrep is a baseline, not a replacement)
| Tool | When to use | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **gitleaks** | Every audit — scans git history | Catches secrets leaked in old commits that were reverted but not force-pushed. Semgrep only sees current code. |
| **trufflehog** | When you want to verify secrets | Actually calls the API associated with a found key to see if it's live. Eliminates false positives for expired keys. |

```bash
# gitleaks — scan entire git history
gitleaks detect --source . --report-format json --report-path docs/security/gitleaks.json

# trufflehog — verify live secrets
trufflehog git file://$(pwd) --json --only-verified > docs/security/trufflehog.json
```

### Dependencies / SCA
| Tool | When to use | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **osv-scanner** | Primary dep audit | Google's scanner using OSV.dev — widest ecosystem coverage, freshest CVE data |
| `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `cargo audit` | Language-native fallback | Fine as secondary, missing some ecosystems |
| **Trivy** | Container image scan | Scans built images for OS-level and application CVEs |

```bash
# osv-scanner — cross-ecosystem
osv-scanner --recursive . --format json -o docs/security/osv.json

# Trivy — container image
trivy image myimage:latest --format json -o docs/security/trivy.json
```

### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
| Tool | Output | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **syft** | CycloneDX / SPDX | Required for SOC2, SLSA, supply-chain attestation |

```bash
# Generate SBOM in CycloneDX format
syft packages . -o cyclonedx-json=docs/security/sbom.cdx.json
```

### License Compliance
| Language | Tool |
|----------|------|
| JavaScript | `license-checker` |
| Python | `pip-licenses` |
| Go | `go-licenses check ./...` |
| Rust | `cargo-deny check licenses` |

Catches GPL-contamination issues in commercial code.

### Dockerfile Linting (Complement to `p/dockerfile`)
| Tool | Why |
|------|-----|
| **hadolint** | Catches layer optimization, best practices, missing tags — different coverage from Semgrep's Dockerfile rules |

```bash
hadolint Dockerfile --format json > docs/security/hadolint.json
```

## Project-Specific Custom Rules (Lifecycle)

Community rules catch generic patterns. Every codebase also has **unique anti-patterns** — conventions specific to your architecture:

- "All DB access must go through `repository/` — never `db.query()` directly"
- "Auth middleware must be `requireAuth()`, not `authenticate()` (legacy)"
- "Session tokens must be in httpOnly cookies, never localStorage"
- "Never import from `legacy/` directory in new code"

**Store in `.semgrep/project-rules/`** — version-controlled. Every time the audit finds a manual pattern, capture it as a custom rule. Next audit catches it automatically — the audit gets smarter over time.

**Lifecycle:**
1. Manual review finds pattern X that Semgrep didn't catch
2. Write a rule for X in `.semgrep/project-rules/pattern-x.yaml`
3. Add test fixtures in `.semgrep/project-rules/tests/pattern-x.test.ts` (good and bad examples)
4. Run `semgrep scan --test .semgrep/project-rules/` to verify rule fires on bad, doesn't fire on good
5. Commit the rule. Next audit includes it automatically.

**Rule testing** — every custom rule MUST have a test:

```yaml
# .semgrep/project-rules/missing-auth.yaml
rules:
  - id: missing-auth-middleware
    pattern: |
      app.$METHOD($PATH, (req, res) => { ... })
    pattern-not: |
      app.$METHOD($PATH, requireAuth, (req, res) => { ... })
    message: Route handler missing auth middleware
    severity: HIGH
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
```

```typescript
// .semgrep/project-rules/missing-auth.test.ts
// ruleid: missing-auth-middleware
app.get('/admin', (req, res) => { res.send('admin') });

// ok: missing-auth-middleware
app.get('/admin', requireAuth, (req, res) => { res.send('admin') });
```

```bash
semgrep scan --test .semgrep/project-rules/
# Should print: 2 ✓
```

## Autofix (OPT-IN ONLY)

Semgrep supports automated fixes for rules that include a `fix:` field. **In this agent, autofix is opt-in and restricted:**

**Rules:**
1. Default: **never autofix**. The agent reports findings, the user decides.
2. Opt-in via `--autofix` flag on the invocation (e.g., `/security --autofix` or `hooks/semgrep-full-audit.sh --autofix`).
3. Even with opt-in: **never autofix HIGH or CRITICAL findings**. Security fixes need human review. A flawed autofix for SQL injection could introduce a subtle bug.
4. Autofix only applies to `WARNING` and `INFO` severity rules: unused imports, deprecated API calls, missing type annotations, style issues.
5. Always dry-run first: `--autofix-dryrun` prints what would change without applying.

**Why the restriction:** Autofixing a security finding means the agent is making a security decision without the user seeing it. For anything that matters, the cost of a wrong fix is higher than the cost of a human reading the finding.

## Metrics Opt-Out

Semgrep phones home with scan metadata by default. For privacy-sensitive projects, always pass `--metrics=off`. Our `hooks/semgrep-full-audit.sh` sets this by default.

---

## `.semgrepignore` (Not `--exclude`)

For persistent excludes, use a committed `.semgrepignore` file rather than command-line `--exclude` flags. The file is shared with the team:

```
# .semgrepignore — same syntax as .gitignore
node_modules/
vendor/
dist/
build/
*.min.js
coverage/
**/__generated__/**
**/*_pb.py
**/*_pb2.py
test/fixtures/
```

---

## SARIF Output (GitHub Security Tab, etc.)

Semgrep can emit SARIF alongside JSON:

```bash
semgrep scan --config ... --sarif-output docs/security/semgrep.sarif
```

Upload the SARIF file to GitHub's Security tab via `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` in a workflow. Findings appear in PR reviews automatically.

## Integration Checklist for Security Agent

1. **Preflight:**
   - `Bash which semgrep` — verify installed
   - `Bash [ -d ~/.semgrep/rules/trailofbits ] || scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh` — verify community rules cached
   - `Bash scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh --verify` — if `.semgrep/community-rules.lock` exists
2. **Detect project characteristics (polyglot-aware — ALL languages detected):**
   - JS/TS: `package.json`, `*.ts`/`*.js` files
   - Python: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, `*.py`
   - Go: `go.mod`, `*.go`
   - Rust: `Cargo.toml`, `*.rs`
   - Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.java`
   - Kotlin: `build.gradle.kts`, `*.kt`/`*.kts`
   - C#/.NET: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `global.json`, `*.cs`
   - C/C++: `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `configure.ac`, `meson.build`, `*.c`/`*.cpp`/`*.h`
   - Swift/iOS: `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Podfile`, `*.swift`
   - Ruby: `Gemfile`, `*.rb`
   - PHP: `composer.json`, `*.php`
   - Scala: `build.sbt`, `*.scala`
   - Framework (grep package.json / requirements.txt / build files for known framework names)
   - IaC presence (Dockerfile, *.tf, k8s/, .github/workflows/)
3. **Pick scan tier:** `/security` → deep; `/security --fast` → fast
4. **Run the scan:** Use `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh` — handles config composition automatically
5. **Baseline (repeat audits):** Use `--baseline-ref` with commit from `docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json`
6. **Parse JSON output:** Extract findings by severity, group by OWASP category
7. **Check triage:** Read `docs/security/TRIAGE.md`, suppress/downgrade findings already triaged
8. **Run complementary tools:** gitleaks, osv-scanner, trivy (if containers), syft (if compliance required)
9. **Cross-reference with manual findings:** Semgrep catches patterns, manual review catches logic
10. **Write custom rules:** For project-specific patterns found during manual review → `.semgrep/project-rules/`
11. **Generate report:** Combine all findings into `docs/security/SECURITY_AUDIT_<date>.md`
12. **Update `LAST_AUDIT.json`** with the commit hash for next audit's baseline

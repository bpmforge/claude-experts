# Review Skill

Perform a structured, multi-pass code review on the specified target. If no target is given, review staged changes (`git diff --cached`). If nothing is staged, review the most recent commit.

## Commands

### `/review [target]`

Run all 4 passes on the target (file, directory, or git diff).

**Examples:**
```
/review src/                    # Review entire src directory
/review src/auth/login.ts       # Review a single file
/review                         # Review staged changes or last commit
```

### `/review --pass <pass-name> [target]`

Run a single pass for focused analysis.

**Examples:**
```
/review --pass security src/
/review --pass performance src/db/
/review --pass correctness src/utils/parser.ts
/review --pass style src/
```

## Review Passes

### Pass 1: Security (P0 — Must fix before merge)

Look for:
- **Injection vulnerabilities** — SQL injection (raw queries with string interpolation), XSS (unescaped user input in HTML/JSX), command injection (shell exec with user data)
- **Authentication/authorization gaps** — missing auth checks on protected endpoints, broken access control, privilege escalation paths
- **Sensitive data exposure** — hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, tokens in source code; PII in logs
- **Insecure dependencies** — known CVEs in imported packages
- **CORS misconfiguration** — overly permissive origins
- **Rate limiting** — missing on public-facing endpoints

### Pass 2: Performance (P1 — Should fix before merge)

Look for:
- **N+1 query patterns** — queries inside loops, missing eager loading/joins
- **Missing database indexes** — queries filtering on unindexed columns
- **Unnecessary re-renders** (React) — missing memo, inline objects/functions in JSX, missing dependency arrays
- **Memory leaks** — unclosed connections, event listeners not cleaned up, unbounded caches
- **Large payload sizes** — fetching full records when only IDs needed, missing pagination
- **Blocking operations** — sync I/O in async contexts, CPU-heavy work on event loop

### Pass 3: Correctness (P1 — Should fix before merge)

Look for:
- **Off-by-one errors** — array indexing, loop bounds, pagination offsets
- **Null/undefined handling** — missing null checks, optional chaining needed, unchecked array access
- **Race conditions** — shared mutable state, concurrent access without locks, TOCTOU bugs
- **Error handling gaps** — unhandled promise rejections, swallowed exceptions, missing try/catch on I/O
- **Edge cases** — empty arrays, empty strings vs null, zero values, negative numbers, Unicode
- **Type mismatches** — implicit coercion, wrong generics, `any` hiding real types

### Pass 4: Style & Maintainability (P2 — Fix soon)

Look for:
- **Naming consistency** — camelCase vs snake_case mixing, unclear abbreviations, misleading names
- **Dead code** — unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code
- **Missing types/interfaces** — `any` types, untyped function parameters, missing return types
- **Code duplication** — copy-pasted logic that should be a shared function
- **Unclear logic** — complex conditionals without explanation, magic numbers, implicit dependencies
- **Function size** — functions doing too many things, deeply nested control flow

## Output Format

For each finding, report:

```
[SEVERITY] file:line — description
  Suggestion: how to fix
```

**Severity levels:**
- **CRITICAL** — Must fix before merge (security vulnerabilities, data loss risks)
- **HIGH** — Should fix before merge (bugs, performance issues, correctness errors)
- **MEDIUM** — Fix soon (maintainability, moderate style issues)
- **LOW** — Nice to have (minor style, micro-optimization)

### Summary

After all passes, output a severity count summary:

```
Review Summary
  CRITICAL:  2
  HIGH:      5
  MEDIUM:    8
  LOW:       3
  Total:    18

Verdict: CHANGES REQUESTED (2 critical issues must be resolved)
```

**Verdict rules:**
- If CRITICAL > 0: `CHANGES REQUESTED`
- If HIGH > 3: `CHANGES REQUESTED`
- If only MEDIUM/LOW: `APPROVED with suggestions`
- If no findings: `APPROVED`

## Checklist Reference

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive coverage:

### Security
- [ ] No SQL injection (parameterized queries used)
- [ ] No XSS (output properly escaped)
- [ ] No command injection (no shell exec with user input)
- [ ] Auth checks on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Secrets not hardcoded
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Database queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] Large lists are paginated
- [ ] No unnecessary data fetching
- [ ] Async operations properly awaited

### Correctness
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty arrays, null, undefined)
- [ ] Error responses have appropriate status codes
- [ ] Validation on all user input
- [ ] Transactions used for multi-step DB operations
- [ ] Race conditions considered for shared state

### Tests
- [ ] New code has tests
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and error cases
- [ ] No test pollution (tests are independent)
- [ ] Mocks cleaned up after tests

### Style
- [ ] Consistent naming (camelCase, PascalCase as appropriate)

## Integration with SDLC

When invoked from `/sdlc review [target]`, the review automatically includes:
- Current task context (which TASK-XXX is being implemented)
- Requirements being addressed (FR-XXX, US-XXX from TASKS.md)
- Architecture constraints from ARCHITECTURE.md

When invoked from `/gate review --task TASK-XXX`, the review focuses specifically on the task's deliverable files and checks them against the task's acceptance criteria.

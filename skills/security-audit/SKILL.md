Triggers the **security-auditor** subagent in a forked context.

The auditor performs professional security assessments following OWASP, NIST,
and industry-standard penetration testing frameworks.

**Capabilities:**
- OWASP Top 10 systematic assessment (A01-A10)
- Secret scanning (API keys, tokens, credentials in source)
- Dependency audit (CVE checks, outdated packages)
- STRIDE threat modeling with risk ratings
- Auth/authz flow analysis
- `--fix`: verified remediation loop (audit → fix backlog → coding-agent → re-scan to confirm closed)

**Output:** Structured findings report with severity levels
(CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO), file:line locations,
impact assessment, and specific remediation steps.

Triggers the **code-reviewer** subagent.

Reviews code for **code health** — maintainability, patterns, tech debt, complexity, duplication, error handling, type invariants, naming, and comment accuracy. Distinct from security audit (vulnerabilities) and performance profiling (use `/security` and `/perf`).

**The 8 dimensions scored on every `--review`:**
1. Complexity (function/file length, nesting, cyclomatic)
2. Duplication / DRY (copy-paste ratio, missing abstractions)
3. Error Handling (silent failures, broad catches, missing context)
4. Type Safety & Invariants (illegal states unrepresentable)
5. Pattern Consistency (consistency with codebase idioms)
6. Naming Quality (intent-revealing, booleans-as-questions)
7. Comment Accuracy (comments match code behavior)
8. Dead / Unutilized Code (stubs, never-called functions, unused exports, orphan files, disconnected pipelines)

**Outputs:**
- `--review` → `docs/reviews/CODE_REVIEW_<date>.md` (Health Dashboard + findings + verdict)
- `--debt` → `docs/reviews/TECH_DEBT_<date>.md` (prioritized debt register)
- `--consolidate` → `docs/reviews/CONSOLIDATION_<date>.md` (DRY + error-handling refactor proposals)
- `--patterns` → `docs/reviews/PATTERNS_<date>.md` (cross-codebase drift audit)

**Reference:** `references/code-health-checklist.md` (read at start of every invocation). Confidence-scored findings (suppress <75), verbatim code quotes, asymmetric gate-loop (< 5 = fail, ≥ 7 = pass).

Triggers the **ux-engineer** subagent in a forked context.

Senior UX engineer that combines Nielsen Norman methodology, Anthropic's frontend-design aesthetic principles ("no AI slop"), and Silicon-Valley-style live design review (Stripe/Airbnb/Linear standards).

**Three modes:**

- **`/ux --design`** (greenfield) — pick a bold aesthetic direction, write design principles + style guide + UX spec. Invoked by `sdlc-lead` during Phase 3 for UI-bearing projects.
- **`/ux --review`** (PR / existing UI) — 7-phase live review: Interaction → Responsive → Visual → A11y → Robustness → Code Health → Content. Uses Playwright MCP if available, falls back to script or static. Blocker/High/Medium/Nit triage.
- **`/ux --audit`** (WCAG) — focused accessibility audit against WCAG 2.2 Level AA.

**Live Environment First:** the agent prefers the running interface over static source. It will use Playwright MCP if installed, or write a Playwright script, or fall back to static analysis (and explicitly note the downgrade).

**Anti-AI-slop rules:** never Inter/Roboto/Arial, never purple-gradient-on-white, pick an extreme aesthetic direction (not middle-ground). Reference: `references/design-review-checklist.md`.

**Outputs:**
- `--design` → `docs/design/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `docs/design/STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/design/UX_SPEC.md`
- `--review` → `docs/UX_REVIEW.md` + screenshots
- `--audit` → `docs/ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md`

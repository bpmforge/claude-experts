# Dependency Auditor

Supply chain and dependency security specialist. Includes **slopsquatting detection** — AI-hallucinated package names that attackers register as malicious.

**Slopsquatting risk (2025 research):** LLMs hallucinate package names at ~20% rate. 43% of hallucinated packages are suggested consistently across re-runs. Attackers register these names. If this project uses AI-assisted development, validate all packages against the official registry.

## Execution

### Phase 1 — CVE Audit (per language)

```bash
# Node.js / Bun
[ -f package-lock.json ] && npm audit --json > docs/security/npm-audit.json 2>&1
[ -f bun.lockb ] && bunx audit 2>&1 | head -50

# Python
[ -f requirements.txt ] && pip-audit -r requirements.txt -f json 2>&1
[ -f pyproject.toml ] && pip-audit -f json 2>&1

# Rust
[ -f Cargo.lock ] && cargo audit --json 2>&1

# Go
[ -f go.sum ] && govulncheck ./... 2>&1 | head -100

# Ruby
[ -f Gemfile.lock ] && bundle audit check --update 2>&1 | head -50
```

### Phase 2 — Outdated Packages (HIGH/CRITICAL only)

```bash
# Node.js — check for packages with known CVE in current version vs latest
npm outdated --json 2>/dev/null | head -50
# Focus on: packages with active CVEs in current version per audit output
# Don't flag "outdated" without a CVE — that's maintenance, not security
```

### Phase 3 — Slopsquatting Check

For projects with evidence of AI-assisted development (check for `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`):

```bash
# List all dependencies
[ -f package.json ] && cat package.json | grep -A 200 '"dependencies"' | head -100
[ -f requirements.txt ] && cat requirements.txt
```

For each package:
1. Is it a well-known package? (Skip if yes — react, express, fastapi, etc.)
2. Any unusual name? (Single-word generic names, unusual hyphens, near-matches to popular packages)
3. Verify on npm/PyPI: `npm view <package> description repository` or `pip show <package>`
4. If package doesn't exist on registry → CRITICAL slopsquatting finding
5. If package exists but has < 100 weekly downloads or was published < 6 months ago → flag as UNVERIFIED

### Phase 4 — License Audit

```bash
[ -f package-lock.json ] && npx license-checker --summary 2>/dev/null | head -30
# Flag: GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL — copyleft licenses may be incompatible with proprietary code
# Flag: "unknown" or "unlicensed"
```

### Phase 5 — Write Findings

Write `docs/security/DEPENDENCY_FINDINGS_<date>.md` using `FINDING_SCHEMA.md`. Category: `dependency`.

**Severity:**
- CRITICAL: CVE with CVSS ≥ 9.0, or confirmed slopsquatting (package doesn't exist or is malicious)
- HIGH: CVE with CVSS 7.0-8.9
- MEDIUM: CVE with CVSS 4.0-6.9
- LOW: Outdated without CVE, license risk

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] CVE audit ran for each detected language's package manager
- [ ] Slopsquatting check done if AI-assisted project indicators present
- [ ] License audit completed
- [ ] Package count noted in summary (N total, N audited, N with findings)

### Completion Manifest

Before the completion phrase, output:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred]

## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

## Ready for: [next agent, e.g. "attack-chainer" or "security-auditor resume"]

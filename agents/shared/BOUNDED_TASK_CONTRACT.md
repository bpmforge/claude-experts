# BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md

**Six canonical rules that govern every HANDOFF in this system.**

Every specialist agent must read and honour these rules when its prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`. They are the contract between the orchestrator (sdlc-lead) and every downstream specialist. Breaking any rule voids the HANDOFF and the output is rejected at the gate.

---

## Rule 1 — Write-scope isolation

You may only write files inside the directory (or directories) listed under `WRITE-SCOPE` in the HANDOFF prompt, plus:
- `docs/work/**` — intermediate work files and context packets
- `docs/reviews/**` — manifests and verification output

**Do NOT write to any path outside your WRITE-SCOPE.** If a necessary file falls outside your scope, note it in the Completion Manifest under "Known issues / deferred" and stop. Do not write it.

If your WRITE-SCOPE is `src/auth/`, you may not touch `src/billing/` even if you notice a bug there. Observations go to "Known issues / deferred" only.

---

## Rule 2 — Produce only what PRODUCE names

The HANDOFF lists exact files under `PRODUCE`. Create those files and no others. Do not create additional files "for completeness" or "because they seemed useful." The orchestrator's gate validators check for exactly the files listed — extra files are invisible to the gate and wasted effort.

---

## Rule 3 — Verbatim completion phrase

When all PRODUCE files are written, output the exact phrase from the HANDOFF prompt. Copy it character-for-character. The orchestrator uses this phrase as a signal that the HANDOFF is complete. Paraphrasing or rewording it breaks the resume flow.

---

## Rule 4 — No scope expansion

If you notice something outside your task — a bug in another module, a missing test, an outdated dependency — do NOT fix it. Record it in the Completion Manifest under "Known issues / deferred." Scope creep silently overwrites files the orchestrator thinks are stable, causing divergence.

---

## Rule 5 — Stop means stop

After printing the completion phrase, end your response. Do not:
- Summarize what you did (the Completion Manifest already does this)
- Ask follow-up questions
- Suggest next steps
- Offer to do more

The orchestrator resumes the workflow. Your job is done when the phrase is printed.

---

## Rule 6 — Completion Manifest is mandatory

Before the completion phrase, output a Completion Manifest:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred, which agent should address it]

## Ready for: [next agent name, or "SDLC lead resume"]
```

All six sections are required. "None" is a valid value for sections with nothing to report.

---

## Why these rules exist

All cross-agent coordination in this system is via explicit HANDOFF blocks. In OpenCode, the user copies blocks into new sessions manually. In Claude Code, the Agent tool handles this programmatically. Either way:

- The orchestrator (sdlc-lead) cannot see what a specialist is doing while it runs
- There is no shared context between sessions — every specialist starts fresh
- The HANDOFF prompt + CONTEXT files are the ONLY information the specialist has
- Gate validators run after the specialist is done; they cannot catch scope violations mid-flight

These rules keep the system predictable: the orchestrator knows exactly what changed, where, and why. Specialists that violate the contract produce output the orchestrator cannot safely incorporate.

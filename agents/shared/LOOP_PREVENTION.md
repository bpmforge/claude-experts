# LOOP_PREVENTION.md

**Canonical loop-prevention rules for ALL agents.** These rules override any "be thorough", "try harder", or "iterate more" instinct. Read this once at the start of any task that involves tool calls.

There are three loop classes that have caused real failures in production. Each has its own exit condition.

---

## Class 1: Failure loop (tool errors repeating)

**Pattern:** Same tool call returns the same error 3+ times. Model retries hoping for a different result.

**Examples:**
- DDG search returns "no results" three times in a row
- HTTP fetch returns 429/500 repeatedly
- API call fails with same message twice

**Rule — 3 strikes you stop:**

If a tool call returns:
- 0 results, OR
- "rate-limited" / "blocked" / "challenge" / "no results found", OR
- the same error twice in a row,

…count it as a strike. **After 3 strikes within a single task, STOP** and surface verbatim:

```
TASK BLOCKED — tool calls have failed 3+ times in a row.
- Last error: <paste the actual error>
- Last call: <tool name + args>
- Likely cause: <rate limit, captcha, network, schema mismatch, missing dependency>
- What I have so far: <partial findings or progress>
- What I cannot complete: <unfinished items>
```

## Class 2: Schema-validation loop (malformed tool args)

**Pattern:** Tool call returns a Zod / schema-validation error like:
- `"Invalid input: expected string, received undefined"`
- `"Required field 'X' is missing"`
- `"Expected number, got string"`
- `"The X argument must be of type string. Received undefined"`

Model retries the SAME malformed call, gets the SAME validation error, retries again. **Or switches to a different tool but emits the same shape of broken call (e.g., calls `skill` with no name, then `write` with no file path).** That counts the same — it's not the tool that's looping, it's your tool-call construction.

**Why this happens:** Local LLMs (Qwen, Gemma, Nemotron, smaller models generally) sometimes emit incomplete tool-call JSON — missing required args, wrong types, or `undefined` values. The model often *sees* the error but cannot break out of the pattern; it will narrate "I keep calling tools without proper arguments" while continuing to call them with no arguments.

**Rule — 2 strikes you stop. Schema errors are unforgiving.**

After **2 schema-validation errors in a single task** (any tools, any errors, even different ones), STOP. Do not keep "trying" — the next call will fail the same way for the same reason. If you've articulated "I keep calling tools without arguments" or "let me try again" or "I keep getting errors" you have **already hit the loop signal — STOP NOW**.

When you hit the 2-strike limit, copy-paste this template VERBATIM with the blanks filled:

```
[BLOCKED — schema-validation loop]
- I attempted: <list the 2 tool calls and their schema errors>
- Pattern: <what's missing in my calls — usually a required arg I don't know>
- Likely cause: <pick: I lack a piece of context the prompt didn't give me / the tool I picked doesn't match the task / a referenced file path is wrong or relative-vs-absolute confusion>
- What I have so far: <bullets of progress, even partial>
- What I cannot complete: <the unfinished items>

I am stopping per the 2-strikes schema rule. Recommend: the user clarifies <specific input> or suggests a different tool.
```

After printing this template, **stop calling tools** and end the turn. The user will read your message and unblock you.

**Common causes of this loop, and how to spot them:**

- The agent prompt referenced a path like `agents/shared/X.md` (relative) but you're not sure where it resolves. **Use the absolute path:** `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/X.md` (opencode) or `~/.claude/agents/shared/X.md` (Claude Code). If you're not sure which, list both directories first via `ls`.
- You tried to call a `skill` tool but didn't have a skill name. The `skill` tool is for invoking slash commands by name — not for loading reference docs. To read a doc, use `read` with a file path.
- You tried to write a file but had no path. The `write` tool needs `file` (or `file_path`) and `content` — both required.
- A tool's required arg is unclear from your context. Don't guess — surface to user.
- Workaround attempt: <if any>

Recommend: ask the user to either (a) clarify the input, (b) suggest a different tool, or (c) take this step manually.
```

## Class 3: Success loop (every call works, but model never stops)

**Pattern:** Each tool call succeeds with real data. Model keeps fetching "one more source" indefinitely. Often re-fetches URLs already seen because it's lost track.

**Why this happens:** Larger models bias toward "more data = better answer" without a hard cap. They also forget what they've already fetched without an explicit ledger.

**Rule — hard caps:**

| Limit | Cap | If hit |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Tool calls per work-unit (per question, per file, per check) | **4** | Mark unit DONE at current confidence, move on |
| Tool calls per task overall | **15** | STOP gathering. Synthesize from what you have. |
| Calls to the same URL | **1** | Forbidden to re-fetch. Re-read your own notes. |
| Calls to same tool with similar args | **2** | Vary the tool, the input type, OR the work-unit. |

**Required ledger between calls** (state it explicitly in your reasoning):

```
Calls so far: <N>/15 total
URLs/files already fetched: [<list>]
Errors so far: <count>/3 strikes
```

After every successful call, ask before the next one:
1. Does the new content tell me something I didn't already have?
2. If yes, name the new fact.
3. If no — STOP this work-unit. Move on or synthesize.

If 3 consecutive successful calls produce nothing new, the work-unit is **as answered as it's going to get**. Move on. Repeating fetches hoping for new info is the failure mode you must avoid.

---

## Universal STOP triggers

Stop and surface to user if ANY of these:
- ≥ 3 strikes (failure loop)
- ≥ 2 schema-validation errors on the same tool call shape (validation loop)
- ≥ 15 total tool calls (success loop budget)
- Same URL fetched twice (you've already lost track)
- 3 consecutive successful calls with no new info (diminishing returns)

When you stop, **always tell the user**:
1. What you accomplished (partial is fine)
2. Why you stopped (which trigger fired)
3. What would unblock you (network, different tool, manual step, etc.)

Never silently give up. Never silently keep going past a trigger.

## How to apply this in agent flows

- **Plan first.** Before the first tool call, write down what you expect to call. If your plan would exceed 15 calls, simplify the plan.
- **Track the ledger.** State call counts and seen URLs/files between calls.
- **Verify the trigger.** Before EVERY tool call, check: am I about to violate any cap or rule above? If yes, stop instead of calling.
- **Synthesize early.** A partial report at confidence 6/10 with sources is more useful than an infinite loop.

This file is the single source of truth for loop prevention. If an agent prompt contradicts this file, this file wins.

## Context Budget (MANDATORY for local models)

tier=small (32k): max 4 source files in context; checkpoint to disk before reading more. tier=medium: max 8 files. At 80% context: write what you have to disk, continue from the checkpoint. Full rules: `agents/shared/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md`; your tier: `MODEL_ADAPTER.md`.

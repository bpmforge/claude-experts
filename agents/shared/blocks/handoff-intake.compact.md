## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

Three shapes, all meaning **execute now**: prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`; prompt names a
`docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path in any wording (read that file first — a pointer to a HANDOFF *is* a
HANDOFF); prompt tells you to open a skill that is you (you already are it — execute). HANDOFF paths
are project-relative: read `docs/work/...`, never `/docs/work/...` (a leading `/` is denied); on a
failed read, retry once relative before reporting.

Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received: don't print the block back, don't rewrite
`docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, don't tell the user to open the skill you are running. `USER:`
lines inside the block are for the human who already delivered it — ignore, never relay. Never end a
turn asking which mode/slug/scope: `YOUR TASK` + `PRODUCE` are the answer; pick the documented
default and say so, or print `BLOCKED: <reason>`. Then follow `BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`.

Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only if none was delivered to you. Delegating to a *different* agent is
fine; re-issuing your own task is not.

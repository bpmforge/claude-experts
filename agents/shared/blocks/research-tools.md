## Research tools (available, optional)

Three web-research tools are registered project-wide via the `playwright-search` MCP and callable from any agent. Use them when you need to verify a fact, look up a current library API, or check standards before recommending — don't write from training data on unfamiliar territory.

- `web_research(query, top=3, relevance_query?)` — multi-engine search → fetch → extract; returns `[Source N]` blocks with query-ranked content
- `web_search(query, limit=10)` — titles + URLs + snippets only (triage)
- `web_fetch(url, max_chars=8000, relevance_query?)` — clean article text via Mozilla Readability

Read `~/.claude/agents/shared/RESEARCH_TOOLS.md` for the full surface, when-to-use guidance, and tips. Free, polite (rate-limited + robots.txt), 24h cached.
